# Mechanics

## Keywords
These worked well in dominion, and make it simple to parse new cards.
gain, trash, retire, sell, attach

## Shop/trade cards

A card played which sits in front of the owner,
and may be activated by other players. 
When they activate it, they get some effect, 
while the owner also get some effect. 
Limits on activation
Each card is once per turn  
- Problems:
    - must provide more benefit to yourself than opponents (otherwise no need to buy)
        * give a further benefit
            - self activation
        * cost for activation
            - we could list the cost on the card
    - does nothing if opponent doesn't activate
        * Self activation
        * Effect on play
    - kingmaker: you can choose a player to win more

Too hard to fit onto one card

## Selling cards

A player puts a card in a place where another player can pay for it.
Theres a few ways this could go,
- Buy the card - but if another person is really willing to pay, why would you give it up?
- Pay for the effect
  - The owner could set a price

## Initiatives

At the start of your turn you get to activate one of the init cards on the field.
These are placed at the beginning of the game.
With *attach* a player can place a card beside an init card, so that whenever someone
activates it, the player also does the action their card says to.

## Red pile

Each one has a trade value of one Red, and has a mild/situational effect.
Having more in your hand allows more purchase power, but any left over end up taking space in your deck.

## Lingering

An effect that lingers on the field until used (a fixed number of times or turns)

# Theme

Typically these games have been about upper class moguls, I've never seen a game that includes the lower classes.
Street Cred - how much favor you have with lower class people

# Currencies
Each currency has its own flavour, and rarity.

## Coin

## Red

+Red lets you draw a card from the Red pile

## Black

No card has black as a discard value.
Black could also exist as a single token, 

# Reducing Overall Cards

## Limited Buying

### Single buy

Cards from this pile can only be bought once by each player.
When a player buys one, they put a marker on it.

### Side deck

A simpler way to implement single buy is to give everyone one copy of each card in the game.
There could be 16 maybe 20 cards.
This also solves the readability problem.

## Shared Single buys

Like projects, these can only be bought once and you must choose between them.
Trashing (retire) the card might retrieve your limited buying.

# Winning
